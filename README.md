# "Appx Installer" Installer

> Thanks for **Online link generator for Microsoft Store** project

`Desktop App Instraller` from [Microsoft Corporation](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/search?hl=zh-cn&gl=CN&publisher=Microsoft Corporation)Â® is a simple tool for those who don't have a **Microsoft Store** (like Windows10 LTSC) to install **.appx** or **.msixbundle** files more easily.

However, it's interesting that this "Installer" itself need to be installed in Microsoft Store. So it is inconvinent in a real pure LTSC to install any UWP application.

This project helps you to install `Desktop App Instraller` to break the first window.  
Then, to get more offline **.appx** packages, please ðŸ‘‰ [Online link generator for Microsoft Store](https://store.rg-adguard.net/)

## Usage

1. Double click `Install.cmd` to install Desktop App Instraller
2. Wait for `All packages installed.` message
3. Close the console. From now on, you can double-click an **.appx** or **.msixbundle** file to install it directly.
